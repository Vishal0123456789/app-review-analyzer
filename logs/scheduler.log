2025-12-01 03:02:13,635 - INFO - # Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-10-29–2025-11-29)

## Top Themes
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users want UI modernization (e.g., landscape mode, updated aesthetic) and advanced trading features (F&O PnL, strategy builders).
    *   Key requests include better watchlist options, consolidated portfolio views, and specific tools like trailing stop-loss and a 'kill switch'.
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Frequent reports of app slowness, freezing, and crashes, especially during peak hours, impacting trade execution.
    *   Users cite delays in order placement, incorrect stop-loss execution, and inaccurate real-time data, often leading to financial losses.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Significant complaints about high and increasing charges, including brokerage and MTF interest rates.
    *   Users find charge deductions unexplained and difficult to understand, comparing unfavorably to competitors.

## User Voice (Quotes)
*   "it felt like i time-traveled back to 2009! the features are good, but please update the ui to match this decade."
*   "when we booked profit it's hangs and buffer and goes profit into loss."
*   "2 lack steal in just charges which not even explained by them."

## Action Ideas
*   Initiate a UI/UX modernization project, focusing on an updated aesthetic, tablet optimization, and landscape mode support.
*   Conduct a comprehensive performance audit to address app slowness, crashes, and real-time data delays, especially during peak trading.
*   Implement a transparent, itemized breakdown of all charges and fees within the app for every transaction.

*   **Charges & Transparency**

## Top Themes
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report frequent app slowness, lagging, and crashes, particularly during critical trading actions.
    *   Significant delays (up to 20 min) and non-execution issues observed with order placement and position management.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   High demand for fundamental trading features like a 'kill switch,' MF pause/resume, and advanced charting tools.
    *   UI clarity issues noted, including confusing F&O displays, small fonts, and unprofessional document formatting.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Perception of high or excessive charges, especially brokerage fees, sometimes negating profitable trades.
    *   Lack of clarity regarding various deductions and reported recent increases in fees.

## User Voice (Quotes)
*   "When placing an intraday order, it often places really late, sometimes after 20 minutes, with the order still pending."
*   "One star is missing for not having a kill switch; it's a must-have."
*   "Sometimes, even in profit, at the end of the day, funds are paid to the app."

## Action Ideas
*   Prioritize investigation into app performance issues, focusing on crashes, lagging, and order execution delays.
*   Evaluate user requests for core features like a 'kill switch' and advanced charting for the product roadmap.
*   Conduct a full review of all user-facing charges to improve transparency and clear communication.

2025-12-02 00:39:52,027 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-19–2025-11-29)

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance:**
    *   Users report severe app slowness, lagging, and refresh failures, hindering real-time trading.
    *   Critical issues like order placement delays, pending orders, and inability to manage open positions persist, leading to alleged financial losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps:**
    *   Strong demand for advanced tools such as a 'kill switch' and better technical indicators.
    *   Users struggle with unclear UI elements, small fonts, and confusing chart controls.
*   **Charges & Transparency:**
    *   Frequent traders face high brokerage fees and new minimum charges, sometimes offsetting trade profits.
    *   Lack of transparency on deductions is leading to distrust and users seeking alternative platforms.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "very glitch app...when my profit happened, I couldn't exit the position..."
*   "you are only missing one star for not having kill switch. it's a must have"
*   "brokerage is a nightmare for scalpers. sometimes even if I am in profit, at the end of the day I end up paying money to the app."

**Action Ideas**
*   Prioritize an engineering sprint to resolve core app stability, performance, and data accuracy issues impacting order execution.
*   Initiate UX research to improve critical trading workflows (e.g., option chain, charts) and evaluate high-impact feature requests like a 'kill switch'.
*   Conduct an urgent review of fee structures and enhance in-app transparency for all charges and deductions.

### Top Themes

*   **UI & Feature Gaps (52 reviews)**

    *   Users seek greater clarity on fee breakdowns and easier access to detailed statements.

### User Voice (Quotes)
*   "worst app in intraday when we booked profit it's hangs and buffer and goes profit into loss."
*   "u only missing one star for not having kill switch . it's a must have picture please make it available"

2025-12-02 02:21:28,611 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-05–2025-11-29)

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report frequent app hangs, buffering, and slowness, especially during live trading, with prices/charts getting stuck.
    *   Critical order execution failures (stop-loss, non-market prices, delays) are causing reported financial losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Significant demand for advanced trading features like 'kill switch,' STP, trailing stop loss, and improved charting tools.
    *   Users seek consolidated portfolio views, easier navigation, and UI refinements for F&O option chains and font size.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Frequent reports of high brokerage fees and transaction charges, particularly for intraday trading.
    *   Concerns over hidden deductions and a general lack of clarity regarding how charges are applied and displayed.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "worst app in intraday when we booked profit it's hangs and buffer and goes profit into loss."
*   "missing one star for not having kill switch. it's a must have picture please make it available."
*   "Brokerage is a nightmare for scalpers. Sometimes even if I am in profit, at the end of the day I end up paying money to the app."

**Action Ideas**
*   Launch a dedicated engineering initiative to address core app stability (freezing, lagging) and critical order execution reliability issues.
*   Prioritize development of key requested features (e.g., 'kill switch', trailing stop-loss) and initiate a review of F&O option chain UI and font sizes.
*   Implement clear, detailed breakdowns of all transaction charges pre- and post-trade, along with a dedicated section explaining fee structures.

*   **UI & Feature Gaps (8 reviews)**

    *   Users experienced unexpected option position closures and reported blocked orders during volatile periods.
*   **Charges & Transparency (1 review)**
    *   A user expressed concern over high brokerage charges, unfavorably comparing them to competitors.

**Top Themes**
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users need confirmation prompts for feature activation/deactivation and improved charting tools.
    *   App font size is too small, leading to confusion.
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Critical app crashes occur during profit booking and market volatility, blocking trades.
    *   Unexpected option position closures resulted in user losses.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Brokerage rates receive mixed feedback, with some users finding them uncompetitive.
    *   The buying NAV for executed mutual fund orders is not displayed.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "It is very annoying to have clicked some buttons accidentally causing unintended activation of services."
*   "Crashing app memory and stopped working, when I want to book profit it crash again and again."
*   "Executed orders do not show buying NAV."

**Action Ideas**
*   Implement confirmation prompts for all feature activation and deactivation actions.
*   Prioritize investigation and hotfix for critical app crashes, especially during high-volume periods.
*   Add the buying NAV display for all executed mutual fund orders.

### Top Themes
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users struggle with chart manipulation and dislike the new option chain display. Key features like 'trade value' on mobile and MF historical views are missing.
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Critical app crashes and freezes prevent users from executing trades. Delayed responses and stop-loss orders executing at worse prices are reported.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Brokerage fees receive mixed feedback; some find them high. Transparency is lacking in the mutual fund section regarding buying NAV.

### User Voice (Quotes)
*   "It is very annoying to have clicked some buttons accidentally causing unintended activation of services."
*   "Really disappointed nowadays, because of crashing app memory and stopped working... when I want to book profit it crash again and again."
*   "It charges a lot of brokerage during trading."

### Action Ideas
*   Prioritize UI/UX improvements for chart tools, option chain display, and font readability.
*   Launch an urgent investigation into app stability issues (crashes, freezes) and optimize order execution response times.
*   Implement clear display of buying NAV for executed mutual fund orders to enhance transparency.

2025-12-02 20:03:22,044 - INFO - ## Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-26–2025-12-01)

### Top Themes
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**: Users struggle with chart tools and font size; report accidental feature activations. Requests for more indicators, desktop features on mobile, and better SIP options are common.
*   **Execution & Performance**: Concerns exist regarding order execution delays, stop-loss slippage, and app crashes, particularly when booking profits. Some users praise fast response times.
*   **Charges & Transparency**: Feedback is mixed on brokerage charges. Users specifically request transparency on mutual fund buying NAV rates.

### User Voice (Quotes)
*   "it is very annoying to have clicked some buttons accidentally causing unintended activation of services."
*   "crashing app memory and stopped working... when i want to book profit it crash again and again and show app memory crash"
*   "executed orders do not show buying nav rat"

### Action Ideas
*   Conduct a UI/UX audit for chart tool usability, font readability, and confirmation prompts for critical actions.
*   Prioritize investigation into app stability issues (crashes during profit booking) and stop-loss slippage in options trading.
*   Implement a clear display of buying NAV for all executed mutual fund orders to enhance transparency.

2025-12-02 21:19:27,267 - INFO - ## Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-26–2025-12-01)

### Top Themes
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users report accidental feature activation/deactivation due to missing confirmation prompts.
    *   Charting tools are difficult to use; mobile app lacks some desktop data points and font size is too small.
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   App crashes, particularly during profit booking, and shows delayed responses in option trading.
    *   Users faced restrictions on buy/sell actions and stop-loss editing during market volatility.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   High brokerage charges are a significant concern, perceived as less competitive than alternatives.

### User Voice (Quotes)
*   "crashing app memory and stopped working... when i want to book profit it crash again and again"
*   "it is very annoying to have clicked some buttons accidentally causing unintended activation of services."
*   "too late response in option trading.. it always exits later at a more lower price resulting in loss."

### Action Ideas
*   **Product:** Implement confirmation prompts for all critical actions (e.g., service activation, large orders).
*   **Engineering:** Prioritize investigation and resolution of app crashes, especially during order execution flows.
*   **Product/UX:** Redesign charting tools for better usability and ensure mobile app data parity with desktop experience.

## Top Themes

*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users report a lack of confirmation prompts for critical actions, causing unintended feature activation.
    *   Charting tools have usability issues, and essential features are missing or inconsistent across platforms.
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Order execution issues, including slow option trading responses and stop-loss failures, are impacting users.
    *   The app experiences frequent crashes and trading blocks during volatile market periods.
*   **KYC & Access**
    *   Concerns regarding personal data security are noted by users.
    *   The efficient AI voice assistant is preferred over repetitive human call center verification processes.

## User Voice (Quotes)

*   "it is very annoying to have clicked some buttons accidentally causing unintended activation of services."
*   "too late response in option trading.. it always exits later at a more lower price resulting in loss."
*   "i prefer your ai voice assistant because it solves my problem in just 30–50 seconds."

## Action Ideas

*   Implement confirmation prompts for critical actions and audit feature consistency across platforms.
*   Investigate and resolve reported order execution delays and app stability issues.
*   Streamline human call center verification processes, applying learnings from the AI assistant's efficiency.

*   **Execution & Performance (9 reviews)**
    *   Frequent app crashes, especially when booking profits, and memory issues reported.
    *   Concerns about slow options trading response and stop-loss orders executing at worse prices.
*   **Charges & Transparency (1 review)**
    *   Users perceive brokerage charges as high compared to competitors.

### User Voice (Quotes)

2025-12-02 22:05:15,002 - INFO - # Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-05–2025-12-01)

## Top Themes

*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report widespread issues with order execution (delays, failures, wrong prices), especially for stop-loss and exit orders, leading to financial losses.
    *   The app frequently suffers from slowness, freezing, and real-time data refresh failures during market hours.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users request advanced trading features like a 'kill switch' and improved charting tools with more indicators.
    *   There's a need for UI enhancements, including consolidated portfolio views and better ETF organization.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Many users perceive brokerage fees as excessively high and report a lack of transparency regarding deductions.
    *   Concerns exist about hidden fees, unexplained charges, and their impact on profitability.

## User Voice (Quotes)

*   "When we booked profit, it hangs and buffers and goes profit into loss."
*   "missing one star for not having kill switch. it's a must have feature, please make it available."
*   "brokerage is a nightmare for scalpers. sometimes even if I am in profit, at the end of the day I end up paying money to the app."

## Action Ideas

*   Initiate a dedicated engineering sprint to resolve critical order execution failures and app performance bottlenecks.
*   Prioritize development and release of key advanced trading features like a 'kill switch' and enhance charting tools.
*   Conduct a comprehensive review of the fee structure and implement clearer, itemized breakdowns of all charges within the app.

### Top Themes
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users report accidental feature activations and significant missing data points (watchlist entry price, 10-year MF charts, detailed option chain).
    *   Usability issues include small font size and cumbersome processes for order management.
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Critical app crashes during profit booking are causing missed opportunities.
    *   Order execution suffers from slow response times and stop-loss slippage, with some positive feedback on overall speed.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Brokerage charges are inconsistently perceived, with requests for more clarity.
    *   Lack of transparency on mutual fund executed orders, specifically the buying NAV rate.

### User Voice (Quotes)
*   "it is very annoying to have clicked some buttons accidentally causing unintended activation of services."
*   "really disappointed nowadays, because of crashing app memory and stopped working, last few days when i want to book profit it crash again and again."
*   "executed orders do not show buying nav rate."

### Action Ideas
*   Add confirmation prompts for sensitive UI actions and prioritize adding critical missing data points (e.g., watchlist entry prices, MF buying NAV, 10-year charts).
*   Investigate and resolve critical app crashes during profit booking and enhance order execution reliability, focusing on stop-loss slippage and response times.
*   Improve transparency for all executed orders by clearly displaying metrics like buying NAV for mutual funds and provide detailed brokerage breakdowns.

## Top Themes

*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users report issues with small font sizes and accidental feature activations due to missing confirmation prompts.
    *   Feedback calls for improved chart tools, more indicators, and a better option chain display.
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   The app is crashing, particularly when users try to book profits.
    *   Delayed order execution, especially in options, and app blocking during volatility are key concerns.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Users have mixed feelings about brokerage rates; some find them high.
    *   A lack of transparency regarding mutual fund buying NAV is a recurring issue.

## User Voice (Quotes)

*   "app font is very small. small font of app is confusing every time."
*   "really disappointed nowadays, because of crashing app memory and stopped working, last few days when I want to book profit it crash again and again."
*   "it charges a lot of brokerage during trading"

## Action Ideas

*   Investigate and implement configurable font size options and confirmation prompts for feature activation.
*   Prioritize investigating and resolving critical app stability issues, especially around order execution and profit booking.
*   Enhance transparency in charges display and ensure buying NAV is clearly shown for mutual fund orders.

## Top Themes
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users report charting difficulties (tools, indicators) and request more data points (trade value, MF charts, NAVs).
    *   Core UI/UX issues include accidental actions, small fonts, and the default post-login screen.
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Stability problems persist with frequent app crashes during crucial moments like profit booking.
    *   Users face blocked orders during volatility and experience significant stop-loss slippage in options trading.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Feedback indicates dissatisfaction with perceived high brokerage charges, suggesting fees are uncompetitive and influencing platform choice.

## User Voice (Quotes)
*   "it is very annoying to have clicked some buttons accidentally causing unintended activation of services."
*   "really disappointed nowadays, because of crashing app memory and stopped working, last few days when I want to book profit it crash again and again."
*   "it charges a lot of brokerage during trading"

## Action Ideas
*   Implement immediate UX fixes: introduce confirmation prompts for critical actions and customizable font sizes.
*   Launch a cross-functional investigation into app stability, crashes during trading, and latency affecting stop-loss orders.
*   Conduct a competitive analysis of brokerage fees and develop a plan to either adjust charges or improve transparency of the current fee structure.

2025-12-04 01:31:25,510 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-28–2025-12-02)

#### Top Themes
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Inconsistent option order execution, stop-loss slippage, and missing positions after order placement are reported.
    *   Charting data accuracy issues, like incorrect index candles, persist alongside feedback on high brokerage fees.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users lack a 10-year historical data option for mutual funds and find the login flow suboptimal (defaults to 'explore').
    *   Strong demand for on-chart Stop Loss (SL) and target trailing functionality; dissatisfaction with the new option chain display.
*   **Payments & Withdrawals**
    *   Users cannot add or update bank accounts, specifically due to recent bank mergers.
    *   This issue impacts accounts related to merged entities, like Andhra Pradesh Grameena Bank.

#### User Voice (Quotes)
*   "too late response in option trading.. even after setting the stop loss at a particular price, it always exits later at a more lower price resulting in loss."
*   "it's very irritating to go through the whole process to trail the sl n target"
*   "unable to update / add andra pradesh grameena bank, as it has recently merged."

#### Action Ideas
*   Investigate and optimize option order execution logic and real-time pricing synchronization to reduce slippage and late responses.
*   Prioritize development for Stop Loss (SL) and target trailing functionality directly on investment charts, as requested by users.
*   Implement a robust bank account management system that accommodates recent bank mergers and allows users to update/add merged bank accounts seamlessly.

**Top Themes**
• **UI & Feature Gaps**
  • Users lack 10-year data for mutual funds and dislike the new option chain display.
  • Usability issues include defaulting to 'explore' and complex stop-loss/target entry.
• **Execution & Performance**
  • Inconsistent response times in option trading cause delays and unfavorable stop-loss executions.
  • Some chart display inaccuracies persist, despite a recent graph-stuck resolution.
• **Payments & Withdrawals**
  • Users cannot add or update bank accounts, particularly those from recently merged banks.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
• "it's very irritating to go through the whole process to [trail SL/target]"
• "too late response in option trading.. it always exits later at a more lower price resulting in loss."
• "unable to update / add bank account, as it has recently merged."

**Action Ideas**
• Prioritize review and redesign of the new option chain display for improved data visibility.
• Investigate and resolve reported delays in option trade execution and stop-loss order triggering.
• Update bank account integration to support recently merged financial institutions for account updates.

2025-12-04 02:02:35,207 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-28–2025-12-02)

#### Top Themes
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Delays and unfavorable prices for option stop-loss orders persist.
    *   Inaccurate index charts and missing option position displays are reported.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   A 10-year data view for mutual fund charts is requested.
    *   New option chain lacks 'Change in OI' and 'Total OI', causing dissatisfaction.
*   **Payments & Withdrawals**
    *   Users struggle to update bank details, especially for recently merged banks.

#### User Voice (Quotes)
*   "Too late response in option trading."
*   "This option chain is not better. Re-include 'Change in OI' and 'Total OI'."
*   "Unable to update / add bank, as it has recently merged."

#### Action Ideas
*   Investigate and optimize option stop-loss order execution latency and pricing.
*   Prioritize restoring 'Change in OI' and 'Total OI' data to the option chain interface.
*   Develop a solution for seamless bank account updates, specifically for merged banking institutions.

2025-12-04 02:17:13,162 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-28–2025-12-02)

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report significant stop-loss slippage and late option execution, leading to losses.
    *   Concerns also include incorrect charting (inverted candles) and positions not appearing.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Requests for 10-year mutual fund data and showing the dashboard by default after login.
    *   Users want to trail Stop Loss/Target directly on charts and dislike the new option chain display.
*   **Payments & Withdrawals**
    *   Users cannot add or update bank accounts that have recently undergone mergers, specifically regional rural banks.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "too late response in option trading.. even after setting the stop loss at a particular price, it always exits later at a more lower price resulting in loss."
*   "a 10 year section not available for mutual funds when sorting or viewing any individual funds chart"
*   "unable to update / add a recently merged bank, as it has recently merged."

**Action Ideas**
*   Investigate and mitigate stop-loss slippage and late execution in option trading.
*   Prioritize development for direct Stop Loss/Target trailing on trading charts.
*   Update bank master data to support recently merged regional rural bank entities for account linking.

2025-12-04 02:19:11,028 - INFO - # Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-28–2025-12-02)

## Top Themes
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Critical issues with options trading, including late execution, stop-loss slippage, and missing positions post-order.
    *   Charting inaccuracies reported (e.g., incorrect candle indications); users request on-chart trailing stop/target settings.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Negative feedback on the new option chain, specifically lacking proper 'change in OI' and 'total OI' display.
    *   Users are requesting a return to the previous option chain interface.
*   **Payments & Withdrawals**
    *   Inability to add or update bank accounts, particularly for recently merged banks, indicates a system update is needed.

## User Voice (Quotes)
*   "Too late response in option trading; stop loss often executes at a lower price, leading to greater loss."
*   "The app shows wrong candle indications on index charts; for example, red candles during upside movement."
*   "The new option chain has no proper display for key data."

## Action Ideas
*   Initiate a deep dive into options execution latency and stop-loss slippage; identify root causes and implement fixes, including addressing charting inaccuracies.
*   Evaluate user feedback on the new option chain; prioritize restoring critical 'change in OI' and 'total OI' displays, or consider reverting to the previous interface.
*   Update the banking system to recognize recently merged banks for seamless account addition and update functionality.

2025-12-06 14:23:37,708 - INFO - # Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-30–2025-12-04)

## Top Themes
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users need to cancel/modify mutual fund orders post-placement.
    *   The new option chain display lacks critical data (e.g., Change in OI, Total OI).
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Reports of order execution issues, app unresponsiveness, and data inaccuracies.
    *   Some positive feedback notes seamless stock trading execution.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Some users perceive charges and taxes as excessively high, eroding profits.
    *   Other feedback explicitly rates brokerage and account maintenance fees as 'excellent'.

## User Voice (Quotes)
*   "I place MF orders but then realize I placed the wrong amount or don't need the redemption."
*   "glith shows something and the actual result is different."
*   "too much charges and taxes."

## Action Ideas
*   **Product:** Design and implement functionality for users to cancel or modify pending mutual fund investment/redemption orders.
*   **Product:** Prioritize adding missing key data points (e.g., Change in OI, Total OI) to the new option chain display.
*   **Process:** Initiate a deep-dive investigation into reported data display inaccuracies and intermittent issues like positions not showing after order execution.

**Top Themes**
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users cannot cancel/modify mutual fund orders post-placement.
    *   The new option chain interface is reported as suboptimal, especially for Open Interest display. The stocks holding page is also inefficient.
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Chart displays frequently get stuck or show incorrect data (e.g., wrong candles).
    *   Order execution issues, particularly in options, where positions sometimes do not appear after an order.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Users report high charges and taxes, significantly impacting perceived profits.
    *   Charges are applied at multiple stages (buy, maintain, sell), leading to substantial deductions.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "I place MF redemption or investment orders but after I realise that I placed wrong amount or doesn't need that redemption then I can't [cancel]."
*   "no position was showing sometimes after buying punching the order."
*   "50-60rs will be taxes while buying and for maintaining and for even selling the stocks!"

**Action Ideas**
*   Explore adding a 'cancel/modify' feature for mutual fund investment/redemption orders.
*   Prioritize bug fixes for critical graphical display issues and options order visibility problems.
*   Implement clearer, detailed breakdowns of all charges and taxes pre and post-trade.

2025-12-06 14:51:09,430 - INFO - # Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-30–2025-12-05)

## Top Themes
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report critical app instability, including crashes, freezing, and login issues, leading to concerns about open positions and potential losses.
    *   Option trading shows significant issues, such as positions not displaying after order placement, resulting in user losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   While general UI is praised, users demand improvements for the new option chain, specifically better Open Interest display.
    *   Requests include more efficient holdings display (direct P&L on the page) and better dashboard organization for multiple fund categories.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Users expressed surprise and dissatisfaction regarding new charges for editing personal details.
    *   Many users perceive current charges and taxes as excessively high, significantly reducing net profits.

## User Voice (Quotes)
*   "many times in option trading after taking a trade, position doesn't show for a long time and due to this we get losses and losses."
*   "This option chain is not better... no proper display in new option chain."
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes"

## Action Ideas
*   Prioritize engineering resources to stabilize the app, addressing crashes, freezes, and critical option position display errors immediately.
*   Initiate a UX research sprint to gather detailed feedback on the new option chain and redesign it for improved data visibility (e.g., Open Interest).
*   Conduct an internal review of new charges for personal detail edits and enhance transparency around all transaction fees and taxes.

2025-12-06 14:59:19,716 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-30–2025-12-05)

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Frequent reports of app crashes and unresponsiveness, hindering access to accounts and positions.
    *   Persistent issues with option trading position display after order placement, leading to reported user losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users appreciate app simplicity but request improvements to the option chain display, specifically regarding Open Interest (OI) data.
    *   The dashboard is noted as messy for multiple funds; users seek grouping features and real-time portfolio P&L tracking.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Concerns raised about unexpected charges for editing personal details and high overall trading fees.
    *   Conflicting feedback also rates brokerage and account maintenance fees as 'excellent'.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "many times in option trading after taking a trade, position doesn't show for a long time and due to this we get losses and losses."
*   "this option chain is not better..so please give old option chain with change in oi and total oi.."
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes while buying and for maintaining and for even selling the stocks!"

**Action Ideas**
*   Prioritize investigation and resolution of critical app stability issues and options trading display bugs.
*   Review and improve the option chain display, re-introducing clear Open Interest (OI) data. Explore dashboard enhancements for multi-fund users.
*   Conduct an internal audit of all charges and ensure clear, upfront communication on fees, especially for personal detail edits and general trading costs.

2025-12-06 15:04:16,662 - INFO - # Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-30–2025-12-05)

## Top Themes

*   **Execution & Performance**: Users report frequent app crashes, freezes, and login issues, especially during critical trading times. Data accuracy and order execution problems, particularly in options, lead to reported losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**: Users seek mutual fund order modification, Open Interest (OI) data in the new option chain, and improved visibility/organization for holdings and dashboard funds.
*   **Charges & Transparency**: Users report unexpected charges (e.g., for editing personal details) and significant deductions from profits due to charges and taxes. Customer service explanations are often inadequate.

## User Voice (Quotes)

*   "many times in option trading after taking a trade, position doesn't show for a long time and due to this we get losses and losses."
*   "stocks holding page is way too ineffecient, requiring numerous taps to see p&l and current share price change"
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes..."

## Action Ideas

*   Prioritize critical bug fixes for app stability, login issues, and data accuracy, with a focus on options trading flows.
*   Enhance the new option chain to re-introduce essential Open Interest (OI) data and improve overall display and readability.
*   Conduct a full audit of all app-related charges, improve in-app transparency, and provide detailed explanations via customer service.

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report frequent app crashes, login issues, and incorrect market data, particularly affecting option trading.
    *   Despite issues, general stock trading is often praised for user-friendliness and seamless execution.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Difficulty modifying mutual fund orders, poor option chain OI display, and inefficient stock holdings page are key concerns.
    *   Users desire real-time portfolio P&L updates and better mutual fund dashboard organization.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   New, unexpected charges for editing personal details and high overall transaction fees are causing frustration.
    *   Conversely, some users commend the app's brokerage and account maintenance fees.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "app not working today"
*   "this option chain is not better... there is no proper display in new option chain."
*   "unexpected from the side of company... start charge for edit personal details"

**Action Ideas**
*   Prioritize investigation and resolution of app crashes, login failures, and market data discrepancies.
*   Develop functionality for users to modify/cancel pending mutual fund orders and enhance the option chain's OI display.
*   Review and communicate changes to personal detail editing charges; provide clearer breakdowns of all transaction fees and taxes.

2025-12-06 15:31:14,273 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-30–2025-12-05)

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance**: Users report frequent app crashes, unresponsiveness, and login failures during critical market hours. Trade execution issues and incorrect position displays are common, particularly affecting option trading.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**: The new option chain lacks key data like Change in OI and Total OI. Users find the stock holdings page inefficient and cannot modify/cancel mutual fund orders.
*   **Charges & Transparency**: Concerns raised about unexpected charges, high fees, and insufficient explanations from customer support.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "app not working today... will growww compensate if i have losses cause of this"
*   "this option chain is not better..so please give old option chain with change in oi and total oi.."
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes while buying and for maintaining and for even selling the stocks!"

**Action Ideas**
*   Prioritize an urgent investigation into app unresponsiveness and critical trade execution failures, focusing on option trading stability.
*   Redesign the option chain to reintroduce Change in OI and Total OI. Improve the stock holdings page for direct P&L and price change visibility.
*   Conduct an audit of all user-facing charges. Ensure clear communication of all fees before transaction confirmation and improve customer support training.

2025-12-06 15:54:46,903 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-30–2025-12-05)

#### Top Themes
*   **Execution & Performance**: App stability issues (crashing, unresponsiveness) prevent access and trading. Users report trade execution problems, particularly in options, and data inaccuracies.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**: Inability to cancel or modify mutual fund orders. The new option chain is unclear, lacking essential data. Holdings pages need better P&L views and dedicated MF sections.
*   **Charges & Transparency**: Users report unexpected new charges (e.g., editing personal details). High charges and taxes (up to 50-60% of profits) are a significant concern, with inadequate explanations.

#### User Voice (Quotes)
*   "unable to open my app it's not responding"
*   "This option chain is not better... there is no proper display in new option chain."
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes..."

#### Action Ideas
*   Prioritize an engineering sprint to resolve critical app stability issues and trade execution bugs (e.g., options positions not displaying).
*   Develop features for mutual fund order modification/cancellation and enhance the option chain display with key data like Change in OI.
*   Conduct a full review of all user charges, ensure transparent in-app communication, and provide comprehensive training for customer support on fee explanations.

2025-12-06 16:00:07,422 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-30–2025-12-05)

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report frequent app crashes, unresponsiveness, and order execution failures during market hours.
    *   Positions not displaying correctly, inaccurate chart data, and prevented position management are causing user losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Lack of mutual fund order modification/cancellation and preference for the old option chain are noted.
    *   Inefficient stock holdings page and missing total portfolio P&L display are user frustrations.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Frustration over high charges and taxes significantly reducing profits.
    *   Users request clearer explanations for charges and report new charges for personal detail edits.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "many times in option trading after taking a trade, position doesn't show for a long time and due to this we get losses and losses."
*   "this option chain is not better..so please give old option chain with change in oi and total oi.. there is no proper dispay in new option chain."
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes while buying and for maintaining and for even selling the stocks!"

**Action Ideas**
*   Prioritize and resolve critical app stability and order execution issues, especially during market hours.
*   Redesign the option chain to include 'change in OI' and 'total OI', and streamline the stock holdings P&L view.
*   Review and simplify the charges structure; provide clear, in-app explanations for all fees.

2025-12-06 16:24:12,456 - INFO - # Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-23–2025-12-05)

## Top Themes
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report frequent app instability (crashes, unresponsiveness) and critical issues with live data accuracy, pricing, and chart displays.
    *   Significant execution latency, especially in options, and blocked orders during volatility are causing user losses and frustration.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Strong demand for advanced charting tools, an improved option chain display, and several missing features like weekly SIPs and mutual fund holdings.
    *   UI concerns include small font sizes, accidental feature activations due to lack of confirmation, and an inefficient stock holdings display.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Users perceive brokerage fees and general charges as high, citing the new minimum brokerage fee as a deterrent to new investments.
    *   Frustration over unexplained fees and a lack of clear communication from customer support regarding various charges.

## User Voice (Quotes)
*   "too late response in option trading... it always exits later at a more lower price resulting in loss."
*   "very annoying to have clicked some buttons accidentally causing unintended activation of services."
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes..."

## Action Ideas
*   Prioritize a dedicated engineering sprint to resolve app crashing, live data inaccuracies, and execution latency, especially in options trading.
*   Initiate discovery for charting tool enhancements (e.g., more indicators, easier manipulation) and re-evaluate the option chain display and functionality.
*   Conduct a comprehensive review of all user-facing charges, implement clearer fee breakdowns in-app, and provide enhanced training for customer support on fee explanations.

2025-12-06 16:49:11,775 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-23–2025-12-05)

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users face frequent glitches, app crashes, and unresponsiveness, impacting core trading functions like the option chain and profit booking.
    *   Data accuracy and live updates are problematic, leading to order execution issues and potential losses during market volatility.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Persistent requests for enhanced charting tools, full-screen option chains with Greeks, and more indicators are noted.
    *   Users report inefficient navigation, small font sizes, missing key data points, and a desire for better holdings management.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Many users perceive overall charges, including new minimum brokerage fees, as excessive and higher than competitors.
    *   There is a strong demand for clearer explanations regarding brokerage, maintenance, and selling fees.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "crashing app memory and stopped working, last few days when I want to book profit it crash again and again"
*   "stocks holding page is way too ineffecient, requiring numerous taps to see p&l and current share price change, its a hassle"
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes while buying and for maintaining and for even selling the stocks.!"

**Action Ideas**
*   Prioritize fixes for critical bugs causing app crashes, unresponsiveness, and order execution failures, especially during market volatility.
*   Conduct a UX audit to improve charting capabilities, option chain display, and the stock holdings page for better data visibility and fewer taps.
*   Review the impact of new minimum brokerage fees and other charges, and enhance in-app transparency around all fees and taxes.

### Top Themes
*   **Execution & Performance**: App stability issues, including crashes and unresponsiveness, are preventing trades. Users report delayed market data and position updates, often causing financial losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**: Users lack options to modify mutual fund orders and criticize the new option chain for missing key data. Demand for improved portfolio visibility and dashboard organization persists.
*   **Charges & Transparency**: Unexpected and perceived excessive charges, particularly taxes, are frustrating users. There is a strong call for clearer explanations of all levied fees.

### User Voice (Quotes)
*   "app not working today... will growww compensate if i have losses cause of this"
*   "Stocks holding page is way too inefficient, requiring numerous taps to see P&L and current share price change, its a hassle."
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes"

### Action Ideas
*   Prioritize an engineering sprint to address critical app stability (crashes, unresponsiveness) and ensure real-time data accuracy for market and trade positions.
*   Investigate adding a short grace period for mutual fund orders to allow modification/cancellation and re-evaluate option chain display for essential data points.
*   Enhance transparency for all charges by providing detailed post-transaction breakdowns and improving in-app explanations for fees.

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report critical app stability issues: crashes, unresponsiveness, and login failures preventing trades.
    *   Inaccurate data, display glitches, and delayed position tracking led to reported losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Feedback highlights missing features like mutual fund order cancellation and fund grouping on the dashboard.
    *   The new option chain UI lacks proper Open Interest display; stock holdings page is considered inefficient.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Frequent complaints about high and numerous charges, including taxes significantly impacting profits.
    *   Concerns regarding unexplained charges and unexpected new fees.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "application glith shows something and the actual result is different. trade gets closed and the screen shows a strange amount which was not there during trade."
*   "This option chain is not better... there is no proper display in new option chain."
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes while buying and for maintaining and for even selling the stocks!"

**Action Ideas**
*   Initiate immediate investigation into critical app stability (crashes, unresponsiveness) and data accuracy defects.
*   Conduct targeted UX research on the option chain UI and stock holdings page to improve display and efficiency.
*   Review all current charges for transparency and improve customer support training on explaining fee structures.

### Top Themes
• **Execution & Performance** – Frequent app crashes, unresponsiveness, and login failures. Inaccurate data display and delayed trade execution lead to reported losses.
• **UI & Feature Gaps** – Inability to cancel mutual fund orders post-placement. Option chain lacks clear Open Interest; stock holdings page is inefficient for P&L.
• **Charges & Transparency** – Unexpected charges reported, even for editing details. High taxes/charges impact profitability, with some users citing poor explanation from support.

### User Voice (Quotes)
• "many times in option trading after taking a trade, position doesn't show for a long time and due to this we get losses and losses."
• "Stocks holding page is way too inefficient, requiring numerous taps to see P&L."
• "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes while buying and for maintaining and for even selling the stocks!"

### Action Ideas
• Prioritize engineering sprint for app stability, crash reduction, and data consistency fixes.
• Design solutions for mutual fund order modification/cancellation and improve option chain UI with clear OI data.
• Review all charges/taxes, enhancing in-app transparency and customer support explanations for charges.

2025-12-06 17:01:21,057 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-30–2025-12-05)

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance:** Users report frequent app crashes, outages, and unresponsive behavior, often preventing login or access to current positions. Key data, especially for options, is inaccurate or doesn't display post-execution, leading to reported losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps:** Core complaints include inability to cancel mutual fund orders and a new option chain lacking crucial 'change in OI' and 'total OI' data. Users also find the stock holdings page inefficient.
*   **Charges & Transparency:** Concerns raised about unexpected charges (e.g., editing personal details) and high taxes reducing profits. Customer service explanations for charges are often deemed inadequate.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "position doesn't show for a long time and due to this we get losses and losses."
*   "this option chain is not better..so please give old option chain with change in oi and total oi."
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes while buying and for maintaining and for even selling the stocks!"

**Action Ideas**
*   Initiate a dedicated "Stability & Data Integrity" engineering sprint focusing on critical app outages and real-time display of executed option positions.
*   Expedite design and development for mutual fund order modification/cancellation and immediately review the option chain UI to reinstate critical OI data.
*   Conduct a full audit of all app charges, specifically the "edit personal details" charge, and implement a mandatory customer service training module on transparent charge explanations.

2025-12-06 17:07:01,226 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-30–2025-12-05)

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report frequent app instability (crashes, freezes) and failure to open.
    *   Issues with order execution and position display, especially in options, causing reported losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users request ability to cancel/modify mutual fund orders post-placement.
    *   Stock holdings page is inefficient, needing multiple taps for P&L and current price.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Concerns about new, unexpected charges (e.g., for editing personal details).
    *   Complaints of excessive charges/taxes on transactions and poor explanation from customer service.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "many times in option trading after taking a trade, position doesn't show for a long time and due to this we get losses and losses."
*   "stocks holding page is way too ineffecient, requiring numerous taps to see p&l and current share price change, its a hassle"
*   "Too much charges and taxes. If you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes."

**Action Ideas**
*   Form a dedicated task force to resolve critical app stability and options trading position update issues urgently.
*   Enhance stock holdings page UI for fewer taps to P&L. Evaluate MF order modification for roadmap.
*   Review all charges. Create an in-app section and update customer service scripts for transparent explanations.

2025-12-06 17:15:36,483 - INFO - ### Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-30–2025-12-05)

**Top Themes**
*   **Execution & Performance**
    *   Users report frequent app instability, including crashes, freezing, and login issues.
    *   Critical issues persist with order execution, incorrect display of trade positions, and inaccurate data.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps**
    *   Users request the ability to modify/cancel mutual fund orders and dislike the new option chain, citing missing OI data.
    *   Feedback highlights inefficient stock holdings pages and a messy dashboard lacking fund grouping.
*   **Charges & Transparency**
    *   Users are surprised by new charges for editing personal details and perceive overall fees as excessively high.
    *   Concerns exist over 'unnecessary charges' lacking clear explanations from customer support.

**User Voice (Quotes)**
*   "The app is showing wrong index chart candles."
*   "This option chain is not better; please give the old one with change in OI and total OI display."
*   "Too many charges and taxes. If you get 100rs profit, 50-60rs will be taxes."

**Action Ideas**
*   Prioritize engineering efforts to resolve critical app instability, including crashes, freezes, and login failures.
*   Initiate a UX review of the options chain, focusing on re-incorporating key OI data and improving overall usability.
*   Implement clearer in-app notifications and updated FAQs to explain all charges, especially new fees for personal details.

2025-12-06 17:22:43,702 - INFO - # Weekly App Review Pulse (2025-11-23–2025-12-05)

## Top Themes
*   **Execution & Performance:** Users report frequent app crashes, unresponsiveness, and data inaccuracies. Critical issues like slow order execution and missing position displays in option trading are leading to losses.
*   **UI & Feature Gaps:** Requests for advanced charting tools, indicators, and integrated stop-loss on charts are high. Users also note missing data (e.g., MF holdings, historical data) and UI usability issues.
*   **Charges & Transparency:** High brokerage fees, new minimum charges, and unexpected fees cause dissatisfaction. Users seek better transparency and explanation for all charges.

## User Voice (Quotes)
*   "many times in option trading after taking a trade, position doesn't show for a long time and due to this we get losses and losses."
*   "it is very annoying to have clicked some buttons accidentally causing unintended activation of services."
*   "too much charges and taxes. if you get 100rs profit 50-60rs will be taxes while buying and for maintaining and for even selling the stocks!"

## Action Ideas
*   Prioritize critical bug fixes for app stability, live data, and order execution, especially for option trading flows.
*   Evaluate and roadmap key UI/UX improvements like advanced charting tools and integrated stop-loss on charts.
*   Enhance transparency on all charges; improve in-app fee communication and review the impact of minimum brokerage.
